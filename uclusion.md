***<br>Truthy still incomprehensible - need it simpler.
<br>***<br>Mutating within a loop fails silently.
<br>***<br>Not consistent on requiring end line semicolons.
<br>***<br>NaN implementation missing negative bound.
<br>***<br>Need a create bug policy visible for users.
<br>***<br>Problems with nested functions.
<br>***<br>Taking too long to release memory on string loop test.
<br>***<br>Array equality should allow passing a comparator.
<br>***<br>Website is sloshy on mobile.
<br>***<br>The prototype needs to startup faster.
<br>***<br>The spec should explain how extensions will be handled.
<br>***<br>Disallow function definitions within functions.
<br>***<br>'var' keyword should really be 'let'
<br>***<br>Make shadowing a variable name a compile error - no reason to allow.
<br>***<br>Asynchronous handling must be easier.
<br>***<br>Asynchronous operations taking too long to release memory.
<br>***<br>Our spec has no way to declare a variable immutable. That's required because otherwise no way to hint compiler, code editor, reviewer, etc.

<br>***<br>Obviously looping past array length should be a compile error.
<br>***<br>Instance of failing for strings.
<br>***<br>Shadowing via variable name case sensitivity should be compile error.
